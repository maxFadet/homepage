# Hi everybody! 
## My name is Maksim Padrabinkin
![Maksim](https://github.com/maxFadet/homepage/blob/main/image/my-image-markdown.jpg?raw=true)
## Here is a link to my [homepage](https://maxfadet.github.io/homepage/)
https://maxfadet.github.io/homepage/
## Description
My page contains information about me.
It consists of several sections regarding my interests:
* [About me](https://maxfadet.github.io/homepage/#about_me)
* [My hobbies](https://maxfadet.github.io/homepage/#my_hobbies)
* [Cooking recipes](https://maxfadet.github.io/homepage/#cooking_recipes)

In creating this page, I used languages such as **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

Also, technologies like Flexbox and ES6+ features have been applied.

## How does it work
